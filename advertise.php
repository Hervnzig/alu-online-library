					<h3>Kigali, Rwanda</h3>
					<p>Your time will be divided between applying best pedagogical practices in Computer Science in class, measuring their results, making the call to “use it or lose it”; and actually engaging with students in some of their amazing projects such as coding dojos, building algorithms to trade cryptocurrencies and setting up their very own hackathon. On a higher level, you will be involved in the co-creation of a vision and strategy for the program, setting up the path that will allow students to extend the skills they learned to the outside world as the future leaders of the African Continent.</p><a href="https://www.alueducation.com/careers/job-openings/" target="_blank">View Posting</a>
